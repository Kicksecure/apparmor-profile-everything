Description: AppArmor profile for whole system
 This is an AppArmor policy to confine all user space processes on the system which
 allows us to enforce a strong security model and follow principle of least privilege.
 An AppArmor policy for the init, systemd is loaded in the initramfs which then
 applies to all other processes. Specific policies for many system services/applications
 are also enforced.
 .
 This follows design ideas already present in other operating systems such as Android
 and attempts to make something similar available on desktop Linux.
 .
 In addition to locking down user space, this also protects the kernel as it restricts
 access to kernel interfaces like `/proc` or `/sys`, making kernel pointer and other
 leaks much less likely.
 .
 This does not and cannot confine the kernel or initramfs.
 .
 This is expected to be used in combination with other security technologies such as
 a hardened kernel, strong sandboxing architecture, verified boot and so on.
 .
 This is still in development and breakage is likely. This should only be used by
 developers for now.
 .
